******* Chi-Squared *******

***** Chi-Squared for motivation, intention, attitude, ownership*****

Null hypothesis: The probability of someone getting a very low, low, medium, high, or very high score is equilikely
Alt hypothesis: The probability of someone getting a very low, low, medium, high, or very high score is not equilikely

5-way distribution of scores (very-low, low, medium, high, very-high)
0 <= x < 0.2, 0.2 <= x < 0.4, 0.4 <= x < 0.6, 0.6 <= x < 0.8, 0.8 <= x < 1.0
These divions were chosen arbitrarily. Should there be more time and/or data, the data can be divided further

Alpha: 0.05
Degrees of freedom: 4
Critical value: 9.49
Expected value used: 27/5 = 5.4

Attitude Chi-Sq: 25.037037037037035
Ownership Chi-Sq: 20.962962962962962

Because the chi-squared value for motivation was NOT > the critical, we cannot reject the null hypothesis
Because the chi-squared value for intention was > the critical, we can reject the null hypothesis
Because the chi-squared value for attitude was > the critical, we can reject the null hypothesis
Because the chi-squared value for ownership was > the critical, we can reject the null hypothesis


***** Tables used for 2x2 Chi-Squared *****

2x2 grids were chosen as anything larger resulted in every cell being very small
The two catagories (low and high) represent
0.0 <= low < 0.5
0.5 <= high < 1.0
